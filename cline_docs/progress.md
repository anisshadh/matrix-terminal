# Progress Report

## Completed
- [x] Initial browser automation implementation
- [x] Browser persistence for visual feedback
- [x] Error handling and recovery
- [x] Logging system integration
- [x] Command chaining implementation
- [x] Action queue management
- [x] Test file cleanup

## In Progress
- [ ] Long-term stability testing of chained commands
- [ ] Performance optimization for action chains
- [ ] Edge case handling in multi-action sequences

## Upcoming
- [ ] Graceful shutdown implementation
- [ ] Memory management improvements
- [ ] Additional automation actions
- [ ] Rollback mechanism for failed action chains
- [ ] Conditional branching in action chains
- [ ] Retry mechanisms for failed actions

## Known Issues
None currently identified. The command chaining feature is working as expected, with proper browser state management between actions.

## Recent Achievements
1. Successfully implemented command chaining functionality
2. Enhanced browser state management for chained actions
3. Improved error handling for action sequences
4. Cleaned up test files for better codebase organization
5. Maintained visual feedback consistency across chained commands
