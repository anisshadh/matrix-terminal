# Active Context

## Current Task
Fixed stream handling for browser automation responses to ensure proper success messages.

## Latest Changes
- Modified chat/route.ts to properly handle successful browser automation responses
- Implemented immediate success response stream for automation
- Fixed message formatting to ensure "WEB ACTION:" prefix
- Enhanced stream state management and cleanup
- Improved error handling for failed automation

## Previous Changes
