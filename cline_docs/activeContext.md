# Active Context

## Current Task
Fixed AI response behavior to properly handle informational queries vs automation requests.

## Latest Changes
- Implemented strict response protocol in system prompt to prioritize natural language
- Added explicit rules for when browser automation can be used
- Modified tool_choice logic to prevent unnecessary automation
- Added response format requirements with DIRECT ANSWER/WEB ACTION prefixes
- Enhanced prompt with comprehensive examples and clear triggers

## Previous Changes
- Disabled video recording by default to prevent unnecessary file creation
- Increased session timeout from 30 seconds to 5 minutes
- Implemented proper browser instance reuse within sessions
- Enhanced command chaining with natural language support
- Improved error handling and type safety throughout the system
- Added robust session cleanup mechanisms
- Updated command parsing to handle complex chained commands

## Previous Changes
- Implemented comprehensive chunk validation system
- Added robust error handling with custom error classes
- Enhanced stream state management with retry mechanisms
- Added temporal validation for processing order
- Implemented shadow validation pipeline
- Added cleanup mechanisms for stale sessions and streams
- Removed test files after successful validation

## Technical Improvements
1. Browser Instance Management
   - Session-based browser instance caching
   - Configurable session timeouts (now 5 minutes)
   - Automatic cleanup of inactive sessions
   - Disabled video recording by default
   - Improved browser state preservation

2. Command Chaining
   - Natural language command separation (then, and, comma, semicolon)
   - Context isolation per command
   - Sequential command execution
   - State preservation between chained commands
   - Enhanced command parsing with SmartCommandParser

3. Error Handling
   - Type-safe command processing
   - Improved error detection and reporting
   - Proper session cleanup on errors
   - Enhanced error context in logs
   - Validation of automation parameters

4. Performance Optimizations
   - Reduced resource usage by disabling video recording
   - Optimized browser instance reuse
   - Improved memory management
   - Efficient command chain processing

## Next Steps
1. Monitor browser session management in production
2. Consider implementing browser instance pooling for high-load scenarios
3. Add support for more complex command patterns
4. Consider implementing parallel command execution where appropriate
5. Enhance debugging capabilities with detailed browser automation analytics

## Current Status
The browser automation system now provides reliable command execution with proper session management, command chaining support, and comprehensive error handling. The system maintains browser state effectively throughout command chains and provides detailed debugging information when issues occur.
