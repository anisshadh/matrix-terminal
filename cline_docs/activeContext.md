# Active Context

## Current Task
Implemented command chaining functionality to execute multiple actions in sequence within a single browser instance, replacing the previous behavior of opening new instances for each command.

## Recent Changes
- Modified CommandParser to support multiple actions in sequence
- Updated BrowserAutomation to handle action chains with proper state management
- Implemented intelligent browser session handling between chained actions
- Added action queue management through eventStore
- Removed test files to maintain clean codebase
- Enhanced error handling to properly manage action chain failures

## Next Steps
1. Monitor the command chaining system for any potential issues or edge cases
2. Consider implementing a more sophisticated rollback mechanism for failed action chains
3. Add support for conditional branching in action chains
4. Consider implementing action retry mechanisms for failed steps in a chain

## Current Status
The system now successfully chains commands, maintaining browser state between actions and providing a smoother automation experience. The browser window persists appropriately between chained actions when visual feedback is enabled.
