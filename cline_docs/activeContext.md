# Active Development Context

## Current Task
Migrated from Groq to OpenRouter AI API integration.

## Recent Changes
- Updated API client configuration to use OpenRouter
- Changed model to "anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet"
- Added OpenRouter-specific headers
- Updated environment variable requirements
- Enhanced error handling for API integration

## Technical Details
1. API Configuration:
```typescript
const client = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENROUTER_API_KEY,
  baseURL: "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",
  defaultHeaders: {
    "HTTP-Referer": process.env.SITE_URL || "http://localhost:3000",
    "X-Title": "Matrix AI Terminal",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  }
});
```

2. Environment Variables:
- OPENROUTER_API_KEY (required)
- SITE_URL (optional, defaults to localhost)

3. Model Configuration:
- Name: "anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet"
- Temperature: 0.8
- Streaming enabled
- Tool calling supported

## Current Status
- API integration is complete
- Streaming functionality maintained
- Browser automation working
- Error handling updated
- All tests passing

## Next Steps
1. Monitor system performance with new API
2. Watch for any edge cases in streaming
3. Verify tool calling reliability
4. Consider adding performance metrics

## Known Issues
None currently - migration completed successfully.

## Recent Testing
- Verified API connection
- Tested streaming responses
- Confirmed tool calling
- Validated error handling
- Checked browser automation integration
