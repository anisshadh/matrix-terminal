# Active Development Context

## Current Task
Fixed critical command parsing issues in the browser automation system.

## Recent Changes
- Updated SmartCommandParser to prevent unintended navigation
- Removed partial matching that caused false navigation to Twitter
- Implemented strict command trigger checking
- Added exact word matching for website shortcuts
- Enhanced confidence calculation system
- Removed secondary keywords to prevent false positives

## Technical Details
1. Command Trigger System:
```typescript
const COMMAND_TRIGGERS = {
  navigation: ['go to', 'navigate to', 'open', 'visit'],
  click: ['click on', 'click the', 'press on', 'select the'],
  search: ['search for', 'look up', 'find'],
  type: ['type', 'enter', 'input']
} as const;
```

2. Website Shortcuts:
- Now requires exact word matches
- Removed problematic shortcuts (e.g., 'x' for Twitter)
- Higher confidence threshold for navigation

3. Confidence Calculation:
- Base score from explicit command matches
- Context boost for specific targets
- Additional boost for explicit commands
- Minimum threshold of 0.6 required

## Current Status
- Command parsing system is now more reliable
- Navigation requires explicit commands
- Text input handling improved
- False positives eliminated

## Next Steps
1. Monitor system for any edge cases
2. Consider adding more explicit command triggers if needed
3. Potentially add user feedback mechanism for command confidence
4. Consider implementing command suggestion system

## Known Issues
None currently - major parsing issues have been resolved.

## Recent Testing
- Verified "type in the matrix" no longer triggers navigation
- Confirmed explicit commands work as expected
- Validated search functionality
