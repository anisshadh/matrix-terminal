# Active Context

## Current Work
- Implemented robust error handling and logging system
- Added custom error classes for better error management
- Improved browser automation reliability
- Enhanced command parsing and execution
- Added comprehensive test cleanup

## Recent Changes
1. Error Handling System:
   - Created custom error classes (ChatError, ValidationError, AutomationError, StreamError)
   - Added structured error handling throughout the application
   - Improved error reporting with detailed messages and stack traces

2. Logging System:
   - Implemented singleton logger with different log levels
   - Added detailed logging throughout the application
   - Added log filtering and retrieval capabilities
   - Implemented log rotation to prevent memory issues

3. Browser Automation:
   - Improved element detection and interaction
   - Added better selector strategies
   - Enhanced error handling with screenshots
   - Added detailed logging of automation actions
   - Improved cleanup of browser instances

4. Command Parser:
   - Added Zod schema validation for messages
   - Improved command pattern matching
   - Enhanced selector generation for different element types
   - Added better error handling for command parsing

5. Chat API:
   - Improved message validation
   - Enhanced stream handling and retry logic
   - Better error handling for API responses
   - Added detailed logging of chat operations

## Next Steps
1. Consider implementing:
   - Log persistence to file system
   - Metrics collection for monitoring
   - Performance optimization for browser automation
   - Additional command patterns for more complex interactions

2. Potential improvements:
   - Add rate limiting for API requests
   - Implement caching for frequently used commands
   - Add more sophisticated retry strategies
   - Enhance error recovery mechanisms

## Technical Notes
- Browser automation now uses improved selector strategies
- Error handling is now more granular and informative
- Logging system provides better debugging capabilities
- Command parsing is more robust and flexible
- Test cleanup is more reliable
