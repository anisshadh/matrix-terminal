# Active Context

## Current Task
Enhanced browser automation system with robust visibility, state management, and focus handling to ensure reliable execution of automated actions.

## Recent Changes
- Implemented comprehensive visual state verification system
- Added robust focus handling with proper event dispatching
- Enhanced browser context configuration for reliable visibility
- Improved state management with temporal consistency checks
- Added detailed DOM state snapshots for debugging
- Enhanced error handling with visual state capture
- Implemented quantum-safe execution queue
- Added cleanup mechanisms for browser resources
- Enhanced action chaining with state validation

## Technical Improvements
1. Browser Visibility
   - Always runs with headless: false
   - Uses full HD resolution (1920x1080)
   - Maintains window focus with proper event handling
   - Implements focus maintenance interval

2. State Management
   - Visual state verification after each action
   - DOM state snapshots with element counting
   - Temporal consistency validation
   - Session state tracking with timestamps

3. Focus Handling
   - Method overrides using Object.defineProperty
   - Focus maintenance with interval checking
   - Cleanup on page unload
   - Event dispatching for focus changes

4. Error Handling
   - Comprehensive error catching
   - Detailed logging with visual state
   - Session cleanup on errors
   - Visual debugging information

## Next Steps
1. Monitor the enhanced visual verification system
2. Consider implementing visual diffing for state changes
3. Add support for more complex interaction patterns
4. Consider implementing parallel action execution with proper state isolation
5. Enhance the debugging capabilities with visual timeline

## Current Status
The browser automation system now provides reliable visibility and state management, with proper focus handling and comprehensive error tracking. The system maintains visual state verification throughout the automation process and provides detailed debugging information when issues occur.
