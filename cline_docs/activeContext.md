# Active Context

## Current Work
- Fixed browser automation reliability issues
- Enhanced browser instance management
- Improved error handling and retry mechanisms
- Updated test cleanup process

## Recent Changes
1. Browser Automation Fixes:
   - Added proper browser instance cleanup and recreation
   - Implemented retry mechanism for browser launch failures
   - Enhanced error handling with detailed logging
   - Fixed "Target page context or browser has been closed" errors
   - Added type safety improvements throughout browser automation code

2. Browser Instance Management:
   - Always close existing browser instance before creating new one
   - Added proper cleanup between commands
   - Improved page context handling
   - Set appropriate timeouts for operations

3. Error Handling & Retries:
   - Added incremental backoff for retry attempts
   - Enhanced error logging with context
   - Improved error screenshot capture
   - Added better error recovery mechanisms

4. Test Cleanup:
   - Updated cleanup script to remove all test artifacts
   - Added automation error screenshots to cleanup
   - Ensured reliable test file removal
   - Improved cleanup logging

5. Command Parser:
   - Maintained existing command pattern matching
   - Ensured proper error handling
   - Kept robust validation system
   - Preserved flexible selector generation

## Next Steps
1. Consider implementing:
   - Log persistence to file system
   - Metrics collection for monitoring
   - Performance optimization for browser automation
   - Additional command patterns for more complex interactions

2. Potential improvements:
   - Add rate limiting for API requests
   - Implement caching for frequently used commands
   - Add more sophisticated retry strategies
   - Enhance error recovery mechanisms

## Technical Notes
- Browser automation now reliably manages instances
- Error handling includes proper retries and recovery
- Test cleanup removes all artifacts consistently
- Command parsing maintains flexibility while being reliable
- System handles browser sessions more effectively
