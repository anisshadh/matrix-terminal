# Active Context

## Current Task
Fixed browser automation persistence issue by modifying the BrowserAutomation class to maintain a single browser window across requests when visual feedback is desired.

## Recent Changes
- Modified initBrowser() to reuse existing browser/page instances when keepOpen is true
- Added page state validation to ensure browser/page usability
- Created setupPageListeners() for better code organization
- Updated cleanup() to respect the keepOpen flag
- Removed screenshot capture functionality
- Improved error handling and logging

## Next Steps
1. Monitor the browser automation system for any potential memory leaks or stability issues
2. Consider adding graceful shutdown handling for the persistent browser session
3. Test the system with various automation sequences to ensure consistent behavior

## Current Status
The browser automation system now maintains a persistent window when visible=true, providing continuous visual feedback to users during automation tasks.
