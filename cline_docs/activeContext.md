# Active Context

## Current Task
Enhanced AI system with improved reliability, validation, and error handling, particularly focusing on stream processing and chunk validation.

## Recent Changes
- Implemented comprehensive chunk validation system
- Added robust error handling with custom error classes
- Enhanced stream state management with retry mechanisms
- Added temporal validation for processing order
- Implemented shadow validation pipeline
- Added cleanup mechanisms for stale sessions and streams
- Removed test files after successful validation

## Technical Improvements
1. Chunk Validation
   - Content structure validation
   - Hash-based integrity checks
   - Temporal signature validation
   - Shadow validation pipeline
   - Sequence integrity verification

2. State Management
   - Stream state tracking with metadata
   - Session state management
   - Automatic cleanup of stale resources
   - Retry mechanism with configurable attempts

3. Error Handling
   - Custom ChunkValidationError class
   - Custom StreamError class
   - Detailed error logging with context
   - Proper error propagation
   - Session cleanup on errors

4. Performance Optimizations
   - Efficient validation pipeline
   - Optimized cleanup intervals
   - Improved memory management
   - Proper resource cleanup

## Next Steps
1. Monitor the enhanced validation system in production
2. Consider implementing additional validation strategies
3. Add support for more complex stream processing patterns
4. Consider implementing parallel chunk processing with proper state isolation
5. Enhance the debugging capabilities with detailed stream analytics

## Current Status
The AI system now provides reliable stream processing with robust validation, proper error handling, and comprehensive state management. The system maintains data integrity throughout the processing pipeline and provides detailed debugging information when issues occur.
