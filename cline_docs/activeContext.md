# Active Context

## Current Work
- Fixed browser automation reliability issues
- Enhanced browser instance management
- Improved error handling and retry mechanisms
- Updated test cleanup process

## Recent Changes
1. Browser Automation Fixes:
   - Added proper browser instance cleanup and recreation
   - Implemented retry mechanism for browser launch failures
   - Enhanced error handling with detailed logging
   - Fixed "Target page context or browser has been closed" errors
   - Added type safety improvements throughout browser automation code

2. Browser Instance Management:
   - Always close existing browser instance before creating new one
   - Added proper cleanup between commands
   - Improved page context handling
   - Set appropriate timeouts for operations

3. Error Handling & Retries:
   - Added incremental backoff for retry attempts
   - Enhanced error logging with context
   - Improved error screenshot capture
   - Added better error recovery mechanisms

4. Test Cleanup:
   - Updated cleanup script to remove all test artifacts
   - Added automation error screenshots to cleanup
   - Ensured reliable test file removal
   - Improved cleanup logging

5. Command Parser Overhaul:
   - Implemented new AI-driven SmartCommandParser
   - Added support for natural language command processing
   - Enabled chained command execution
   - Enhanced selector generation with comprehensive fallbacks
   - Maintained backward compatibility with existing interfaces
   - Added robust validation using Zod schemas

## Next Steps
1. Command Parser Enhancements:
   - Implement full action chaining execution
   - Add more sophisticated natural language understanding
   - Expand website shortcuts and common patterns
   - Enhance context awareness for better command interpretation

2. System Improvements:
   - Add rate limiting for API requests
   - Implement caching for frequently used commands
   - Add more sophisticated retry strategies
   - Enhance error recovery mechanisms
   - Consider adding command history and context memory

## Technical Notes
- New SmartCommandParser provides flexible, AI-driven command interpretation
- System now supports natural language input with intelligent parsing
- Command chaining capability added but execution pending implementation
- Enhanced selector generation with comprehensive fallback strategies
- Browser automation maintains reliable instance management
- Error handling includes proper retries and recovery
- Test cleanup removes all artifacts consistently
