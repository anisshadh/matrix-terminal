# System Patterns

## Architecture Overview
The system follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:
- Next.js backend for API handling and routing
- Playwright for browser automation
- OpenAI integration for AI-driven interactions
- Stream processing with robust validation

## Core Components

### Stream Processing
The AutomationEventStore implements a sophisticated singleton pattern with comprehensive validation and state management:
- Maintains stream integrity with hash-based validation
- Implements temporal validation for processing order
- Uses shadow validation for additional verification
- Provides intelligent cleanup of stale resources
- Supports retry mechanisms with configurable attempts

#### Key Patterns:
1. Chunk Validation Pipeline
   - Content structure validation
   - Hash-based integrity checks
   - Temporal signature validation
   - Shadow validation process
   - Sequence integrity verification

2. Stream State Management
   - Stream metadata tracking
   - Session state maintenance
   - Automatic stale resource cleanup
   - Retry mechanism with error tracking
   - Temporal consistency validation

3. Error Handling
   - Custom error classes for specific scenarios
   - Comprehensive error logging
   - State-aware error recovery
   - Detailed debugging context
   - Resource cleanup on failures

### Browser Automation
The BrowserAutomation class implements a sophisticated singleton pattern with quantum-safe execution and comprehensive state management:
- Maintains visible browser instances with focus management
- Implements visual state verification and temporal consistency
- Uses event listeners for comprehensive state tracking
- Provides intelligent cleanup with resource management
- Supports quantum-safe action chaining with state validation

#### Key Patterns:
1. Quantum-Safe Execution
   - Atomic action execution with state preservation
   - Thread-safe operation queuing
   - State isolation between operations
   - Temporal consistency validation

2. Visual State Management
   - DOM state snapshots and verification
   - Visual state capture and validation
   - Focus state maintenance
   - Element visibility tracking
   - Temporal consistency checks

3. Browser Context Management
   - Full HD resolution configuration
   - Focus maintenance with event dispatching
   - Window state preservation
   - Resource cleanup on session end
   - Intelligent session reuse

4. Error Handling
   - Visual state capture on errors
   - Comprehensive error tracking
   - State-aware error recovery
   - Chain-aware error handling
   - Detailed visual debugging

### Command Processing
- Parses and validates automation commands
- Supports multi-action command chains
- Integrates with AI for command interpretation
- Maintains consistent command execution patterns
- Manages action queues effectively

### Action Chaining
- Executes multiple actions in sequence
- Maintains browser state between actions
- Intelligent cleanup handling
- Supports visible/headless mode transitions
- Provides comprehensive chain status reporting

### Logging System
- Hierarchical logging with debug, info, and error levels
- Context-aware logging for better debugging
- Performance monitoring capabilities
- Chain-aware logging for multi-action sequences
- Stream-aware logging for chunk processing

## Design Decisions

### Stream Processing
- Comprehensive chunk validation at multiple levels
- State tracking with metadata and temporal validation
- Automatic cleanup of stale resources
- Retry mechanisms with configurable attempts
- Shadow validation for additional verification

### Browser Persistence
- Browser window remains open when visible=true
- State is maintained across automation requests
- Cleanup only occurs when persistence isn't required
- Intelligent state management for action chains

### Error Recovery
- Automatic recovery from page crashes
- New page creation in existing browser when possible
- Fallback to new browser instance when needed
- Chain-aware error handling with appropriate rollback
- Stream-aware error handling with retry mechanisms

### Performance Optimization
- Intelligent browser instance reuse
- Visual state caching and verification
- Quantum-safe execution queuing
- Resource-aware cleanup strategies
- Focus-aware state management
- Optimized visual verification
- Efficient stream validation pipeline
- Optimized cleanup intervals

## Best Practices
1. Always validate visual and DOM states before and after actions
2. Implement proper focus and window state management
3. Maintain comprehensive visual debugging information
4. Handle errors with visual state capture and verification
5. Consider temporal consistency in persistent sessions
6. Design actions to be visually verifiable and chainable
7. Implement proper state rollback with visual verification
8. Use quantum-safe execution for all operations
9. Maintain focus state throughout automation
10. Implement proper cleanup with resource tracking
11. Validate chunk integrity at multiple levels
12. Implement retry mechanisms for transient failures
13. Use shadow validation for critical operations
14. Maintain proper stream state tracking
15. Clean up stale resources automatically
