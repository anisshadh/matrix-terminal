# System Patterns

## Architecture Overview
The system follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:
- Next.js backend for API handling and routing
- Playwright for browser automation
- OpenAI integration for AI-driven interactions

## Core Components

### Browser Automation
The BrowserAutomation class implements a singleton pattern with sophisticated state management:
- Maintains a single browser instance when visual feedback is required
- Implements state validation and recovery mechanisms
- Uses event listeners for console and error monitoring
- Provides cleanup strategies based on persistence requirements
- Supports chained action execution with state preservation

#### Key Patterns:
1. Singleton Instance
   - Single point of access for browser automation
   - Manages browser lifecycle consistently
   - Maintains state across chained actions

2. State Management
   - Validates browser and page states
   - Recovers from failures automatically
   - Maintains persistence when required
   - Preserves browser state between chained actions

3. Error Handling
   - Comprehensive error catching and logging
   - Graceful degradation on failures
   - Detailed error reporting
   - Chain-aware error handling

### Command Processing
- Parses and validates automation commands
- Supports multi-action command chains
- Integrates with AI for command interpretation
- Maintains consistent command execution patterns
- Manages action queues effectively

### Action Chaining
- Executes multiple actions in sequence
- Maintains browser state between actions
- Intelligent cleanup handling
- Supports visible/headless mode transitions
- Provides comprehensive chain status reporting

### Logging System
- Hierarchical logging with debug, info, and error levels
- Context-aware logging for better debugging
- Performance monitoring capabilities
- Chain-aware logging for multi-action sequences

## Design Decisions

### Browser Persistence
- Browser window remains open when visible=true
- State is maintained across automation requests
- Cleanup only occurs when persistence isn't required
- Intelligent state management for action chains

### Error Recovery
- Automatic recovery from page crashes
- New page creation in existing browser when possible
- Fallback to new browser instance when needed
- Chain-aware error handling with appropriate rollback

### Performance Optimization
- Reuse of browser instances
- Efficient state management
- Minimal resource usage
- Optimized chain execution

## Best Practices
1. Always validate browser and page states before use
2. Implement proper cleanup procedures
3. Maintain detailed logging for debugging
4. Handle errors gracefully with recovery mechanisms
5. Consider resource management in persistent sessions
6. Design actions to be chainable and stateless where possible
7. Implement proper rollback mechanisms for failed chains

## Future Considerations
- Implement graceful shutdown procedures
- Add memory management optimizations
- Expand automation capabilities
- Enhance error recovery mechanisms
- Add support for conditional branching in chains
- Implement sophisticated retry mechanisms
