# System Patterns

## Architecture Overview
The system follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:
- Next.js backend for API handling and routing
- Playwright for browser automation
- OpenAI integration for AI-driven interactions

## Core Components

### Browser Automation
The BrowserAutomation class implements a sophisticated singleton pattern with quantum-safe execution and comprehensive state management:
- Maintains visible browser instances with focus management
- Implements visual state verification and temporal consistency
- Uses event listeners for comprehensive state tracking
- Provides intelligent cleanup with resource management
- Supports quantum-safe action chaining with state validation

#### Key Patterns:
1. Quantum-Safe Execution
   - Atomic action execution with state preservation
   - Thread-safe operation queuing
   - State isolation between operations
   - Temporal consistency validation

2. Visual State Management
   - DOM state snapshots and verification
   - Visual state capture and validation
   - Focus state maintenance
   - Element visibility tracking
   - Temporal consistency checks

3. Browser Context Management
   - Full HD resolution configuration
   - Focus maintenance with event dispatching
   - Window state preservation
   - Resource cleanup on session end
   - Intelligent session reuse

4. Error Handling
   - Visual state capture on errors
   - Comprehensive error tracking
   - State-aware error recovery
   - Chain-aware error handling
   - Detailed visual debugging

### Command Processing
- Parses and validates automation commands
- Supports multi-action command chains
- Integrates with AI for command interpretation
- Maintains consistent command execution patterns
- Manages action queues effectively

### Action Chaining
- Executes multiple actions in sequence
- Maintains browser state between actions
- Intelligent cleanup handling
- Supports visible/headless mode transitions
- Provides comprehensive chain status reporting

### Logging System
- Hierarchical logging with debug, info, and error levels
- Context-aware logging for better debugging
- Performance monitoring capabilities
- Chain-aware logging for multi-action sequences

## Design Decisions

### Browser Persistence
- Browser window remains open when visible=true
- State is maintained across automation requests
- Cleanup only occurs when persistence isn't required
- Intelligent state management for action chains

### Error Recovery
- Automatic recovery from page crashes
- New page creation in existing browser when possible
- Fallback to new browser instance when needed
- Chain-aware error handling with appropriate rollback

### Performance Optimization
- Intelligent browser instance reuse
- Visual state caching and verification
- Quantum-safe execution queuing
- Resource-aware cleanup strategies
- Focus-aware state management
- Optimized visual verification

## Best Practices
1. Always validate visual and DOM states before and after actions
2. Implement proper focus and window state management
3. Maintain comprehensive visual debugging information
4. Handle errors with visual state capture and verification
5. Consider temporal consistency in persistent sessions
6. Design actions to be visually verifiable and chainable
7. Implement proper state rollback with visual verification
8. Use quantum-safe execution for all operations
9. Maintain focus state throughout automation
10. Implement proper cleanup with resource tracking

## Future Considerations
- Implement visual diffing for state changes
- Add parallel action execution with state isolation
- Expand visual debugging capabilities
- Enhance temporal consistency checks
- Add support for complex interaction patterns
- Implement visual timeline for debugging
- Add sophisticated retry mechanisms with visual verification
- Enhance focus management for complex scenarios
- Implement advanced state rollback with visual validation
