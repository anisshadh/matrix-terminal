# System Patterns

## Architecture Overview
The system follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:
- Next.js backend for API handling and routing
- Playwright for browser automation
- OpenAI integration for AI-driven interactions

## Core Components

### Browser Automation
The BrowserAutomation class implements a singleton pattern with persistent browser management:
- Maintains a single browser instance when visual feedback is required
- Implements state validation and recovery mechanisms
- Uses event listeners for console and error monitoring
- Provides cleanup strategies based on persistence requirements

#### Key Patterns:
1. Singleton Instance
   - Single point of access for browser automation
   - Manages browser lifecycle consistently

2. State Management
   - Validates browser and page states
   - Recovers from failures automatically
   - Maintains persistence when required

3. Error Handling
   - Comprehensive error catching and logging
   - Graceful degradation on failures
   - Detailed error reporting

### Command Processing
- Parses and validates automation commands
- Integrates with AI for command interpretation
- Maintains consistent command execution patterns

### Logging System
- Hierarchical logging with debug, info, and error levels
- Context-aware logging for better debugging
- Performance monitoring capabilities

## Design Decisions

### Browser Persistence
- Browser window remains open when visible=true
- State is maintained across automation requests
- Cleanup only occurs when persistence isn't required

### Error Recovery
- Automatic recovery from page crashes
- New page creation in existing browser when possible
- Fallback to new browser instance when needed

### Performance Optimization
- Reuse of browser instances
- Efficient state management
- Minimal resource usage

## Best Practices
1. Always validate browser and page states before use
2. Implement proper cleanup procedures
3. Maintain detailed logging for debugging
4. Handle errors gracefully with recovery mechanisms
5. Consider resource management in persistent sessions

## Future Considerations
- Implement graceful shutdown procedures
- Add memory management optimizations
- Expand automation capabilities
- Enhance error recovery mechanisms
