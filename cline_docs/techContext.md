# Technical Context

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies
- Next.js 14 (React Framework)
- TypeScript
- Playwright (Browser Automation)
- OpenAI API Integration

### Development Tools
- Node.js
- npm (with legacy peer dependencies)
- VSCode

## Implementation Details

### Browser Automation
The system uses Playwright's Chromium implementation with the following key features:
- Persistent browser sessions with state management
- Event-driven page monitoring
- Automatic recovery mechanisms
- Configurable visibility settings

#### Browser Management
```typescript
class BrowserAutomation {
  private browser: Browser | null = null;
  private page: Page | null = null;
  private keepOpen: boolean = false;
}
```

Key implementation aspects:
- Singleton pattern for consistent browser management
- State validation for browser and page instances
- Conditional cleanup based on persistence requirements
- Error recovery with automatic page/browser recreation

### API Integration
- OpenAI API for command interpretation
- Streaming responses for real-time feedback
- Error handling with detailed logging

## Configuration

### Browser Settings
- Viewport: 1280x720
- Default timeout: 15000ms
- Headless mode: Conditional based on visibility requirements
- Sandbox settings: Configured for security

### Development Setup
- Use `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` for package installation
- Environment variables required:
  - GROQ_API_KEY for AI integration
  - Other configuration in .env.local (protected)

## Technical Constraints
- Browser persistence requires proper state management
- Memory usage must be monitored in persistent sessions
- Error handling must maintain system stability
- Performance considerations with long-running browser sessions

## Debugging
- Comprehensive logging system
- Browser console monitoring
- Error tracking with context
- Performance monitoring capabilities

## Future Technical Considerations
- Memory optimization for persistent sessions
- Enhanced state management
- Additional automation capabilities
- Performance monitoring tools
